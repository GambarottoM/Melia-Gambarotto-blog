| General topic ? | Gut bacteria can help us to assimilate drugs more efficiently but they can also make them less effective and harmful.|
| Procedure/what was examined?| Several drugs have been examined such as L-dopa which treats Parkinson’s disease, or digoxin used for cardiac problems. In both cases, some intestinal microbes can inactivate them in a way that varies from person to person. So, it is necessary to find how to prevent the destruction of these drugs by gut bacteria. On the other hand, bacteria can also increase the effects of drugs. This is the case with sulfasalazine (used for rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn’s disease) and metformin (used for type 2 diabetes) which must be transformed by the microbiome to be more effective. |
| Conclusions/discovery ? | To conclude, we note that gut microbes can have a positive or a negative effect on drugs. They increase the effectiveness of some drugs and disable others. But drugs like irinotecan (used to fight colon and pancreatic cancers) can cause intestinal damage  (severe diarrhea) and be toxic for the people treated.|
| Remaining questions? |What is called “pharmacomicrobiomics” is a promising new field of research that needs to be developed. Balskus and Redindo want to improve their knowledge of microbiotal and drugs interactions in order to find more effective treatments of diseases without side effects.|
