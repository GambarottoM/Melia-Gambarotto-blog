| Researchers |Tasuku Ogita is a researcher at Shinshu University (Nagano, Japan) |
| Published in ? | April 8, 2020 |
| General topic ? | Drinking green tea increases the presence of Flavonifractor plautii (FP) a gut bacteria that help to suppress the Th2 immune response that occurs during food allergy. The more FP you have, the less allergic response you get (FP is inhibiting inflammation).|
| Procedure/what was examined|To demonstrate his research findings, Dr Ogita had to do a FP culture out of the intestine during 6 months in order to get a photo of FP. It is important to note that Nagano’s region has a specific diet composed of a lot of fermented food and it could explain why its residents live longer and healthier than in other places of Japan.|
| Conclusions/discovery ? |The abundance of FP in the gut is increased by green tea drinking. This bacteria decreases the Th2 immune response and improves the metabolic processes in the body. |
| Remaining questions? |More testing is needed to ensure the safety of FP if it should be used as an anti-allergy probiotic.|
