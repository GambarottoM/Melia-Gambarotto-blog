# The series 

I have been watching Friends in English of course.

- Season 1 :

- Episode 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 : done, I did not understand everything but I can do a summary. 

# Reading

- I downloaded the BBC News App on my smartphone. I read a article about the tennis, it is soon the ATP Finals in London. (05/11/19)

- I read a article about the tennis again, Roger Federer lost his first match against Dominic Thiem at the ATP Finals in London . I'm so sad. (11/11/19)
